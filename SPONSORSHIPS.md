# Sponsorships

We thank you greatly for taking interest in sponsoring our team and/or our organization. Please, take a moment to read through some of the benefits for sponsoring us.

## Private Donations

We accept private donations through our PayPal link. Take a look at some of the benefits below:

|$ Amount|Benefits|
--|--
|$5.00CAD+|Your name will be mentioned in [`SPONSORS.md`](SPONSORS.md).|

|$30.00CAD+|You will have all benefits mentioned before, plus your photo and name under the *Sponsors* section of `README.md`.|

## Corporate Sponsorships

We understand that we are currently in a time of hardship--the COVID-19 pandemic has put major strain on many companies. Therefore, we are lowering the amount of money we're asking from companies in consideration of these trying times.  

The benefits received as a result of sponsorships will persist for the rest of the season, even after (hopefully) the COVID-19 pandemic ends.  

You can contact us at [our email](mailto:1104a@bramptonrobotics.org) for sponsorship inquiries.
