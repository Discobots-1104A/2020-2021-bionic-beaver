## Contents

This is Discobots 1104A's code repository for the VEX VRC 2020-2021 Season: Change Up.

## Cloning

The method we illustrate utilizes Git, a version control program. However, you can make use of GitHub Desktop, the GitHub CLI, or download the raw .ZIP if you wished.

1. Install Git if you haven't already.
2. Navigate to the directory you wish to clone to.
3. Clone with `git clone https://github.com/Discobots-1104A/2020-2021-bionic-beaver.git`
4. If you wish to specify a branch, use the `-b` flag.

## Building

### Dependencies

- PROS
  - You can get it [here](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-cli/releases).

### Instructions

The method we illustrate utilizes the PROS CLI. However, you can use the PROS Editor (the one based on Atom) instead.

1. Navigate to the directory.
2. Run `prosv5 b` to build alone.
3. `prosv5 mu` can be used to build and upload.

## Contributing

Though we have issue templates and pull request templates, you most likely won't be able to contribute to our code--only added collaborators can contribute.  
That doesn't mean you're not free to clone it, but we dunno why you'd want to clone our bad code.
