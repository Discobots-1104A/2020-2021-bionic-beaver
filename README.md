## Contents

This is Discobots 1104A's source code for the VEX VRC 2020-2021 Season: Change Up.  
The code we write is in C++. Most of the PROS kernel, however, is written in C.  
The current version of PROS used in this program is [`v3.3.0`](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros/releases/tag/3.3.0).

## Cloning

Feel free to use whatever method you would like (GitHub Desktop, Git SSH, etc.).  
We've opted to outline a few methods here.  

### Git

```nan
git clone https://github.com/Discobots-1104A/2020-2021-bionic-beaver.git
```

### GitHub CLI

```nan
gh repo clone Discobots-1104A/2020-2021-bionic-beaver
```

## Building

### Dependencies

- PROS CLI v3.1.4
  - Used to build the project.
  - You can download it [here.](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-cli/releases/tag/3.1.4)
- **OPTIONAL:** PROS plugin for Atom.
  - The plugin interfaces with the CLI, making build a click away.
  - We do not illustrate how to use it here, but feel free to use it.
  - You can install the plugin manually, or *more preferably*, install it using the PROS CLI installer for Windows or which ever install method is best suited for your platform.

### Instructions - PROS CLI

1. `cd` (or a platform alternative) to your directory of your choosing.
2. `prosv5 build` or `prosv5 b` to build the project.  
**OPTIONAL:** `prosv5 mu` can be used to build and upload.
